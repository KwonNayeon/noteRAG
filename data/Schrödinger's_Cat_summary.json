    "1. Schrödinger's Cat is a thought experiment that illustrates the strange principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the concept of superposition.",
    "2. In the experiment, a cat is placed in a box with a radioactive atom and poison gas, and its state of being alive or dead is determined by the decay of the atom.",
    "3. The experiment challenges the idea that particles have definite states until they are observed, and raises philosophical questions about reality and the nature of existence."

      "1.1 Schrödinger's Cat is a thought experiment that helps us understand how strange quantum mechanics can be.",
      "1.2 It shows that particles can exist in multiple states at the same time, like being both alive and dead.",
      "1.3 This experiment helps scientists study the mysterious world of quantum mechanics."

      "2.1 In the experiment, a cat is put in a box with a radioactive atom and poison gas.",
      "2.2 Whether the cat is alive or dead depends on whether the atom decays or not.",
      "2.3 This experiment helps us understand how the behavior of tiny particles can affect larger objects like cats."

      "3.1 Schrödinger's Cat challenges the idea that particles have definite states until they are observed.",
      "3.2 It makes us question whether reality is determined by our observations or if it exists independently.",
      "3.3 This experiment raises philosophical questions about what it means to exist and the nature of reality."
